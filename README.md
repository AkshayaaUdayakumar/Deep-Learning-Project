# Deep-Learning-Project
I have been given Task 3 for this project and I have chosen vision transformers to process and create a model. 
Vision transformer has been build by using keras library by taking code here (https://keras.io/examples/vision/image_classification_with_vision_transformer/)
To run the program in colab, join this link https://colab.research.google.com/drive/12Z1PEa2ooZDONNT5XxOlWj5wxgFoXMTS?usp=sharing
